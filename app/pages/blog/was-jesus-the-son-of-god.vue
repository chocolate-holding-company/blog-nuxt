  The question of whether Jesus existed is generally divided into two parts by
  historians: the <strong>&#8220;Jesus of history&#8221;</strong> (the man who
  lived in 1st-century Judea) and the
  <strong>&#8220;Christ of faith&#8221;</strong> (the Son of God as defined by
  Christian theology).
 </p>

 <p>
  The overwhelming consensus among modern historians, both Christian and
  secular, is that
  <strong>Jesus of Nazareth was a real historical figure</strong> who lived and
  died in the first century.
 </p>

 <p>
  However, the question of whether he was the
  <strong>&#8220;Son of God&#8221;</strong> is a matter of
  <strong>religious faith and theological interpretation</strong>, as the
  available historical evidence confirms his existence and certain facts about
  his life, but not his divine nature or miracles.
 </p>

 <h3>1. Evidence for the &#8220;Jesus of History&#8221;</h3>

 <p>
  Evidence for the historical existence of Jesus comes from both early Christian
  writings and non-Christian sources.
 </p>

 <h4>A. Non-Christian Sources</h4>

 <p>
  These independent accounts confirm several key historical facts about Jesus:
 </p>

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>Tacitus</strong> (c. 56–120 AD): This Roman historian, writing around
   115 AD, mentions &#8220;Christus&#8221; (from whom Christians derived their
   name) being executed by the procurator <strong>Pontius Pilate</strong> during
   the reign of Tiberius. This confirms the time, place, and manner of his
   death.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>Josephus</strong> (c. 37–100 AD): This 1st-century Jewish historian
   mentions Jesus in his work <em>Antiquities of the Jews</em>. One reference
   mentions James as &#8220;the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ.&#8221;
   A longer passage, known as the <em>Testimonium Flavianum</em>, is widely
   believed by scholars to have been partially edited or embellished by later
   Christians, but the core reference to a wise man named Jesus who was
   crucified is generally considered authentic.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>Pliny the Younger</strong> (c. 61–113 AD): This Roman governor wrote
   a letter to Emperor Trajan around 112 AD, describing Christians who would
   meet to sing &#8220;a hymn to Christ, as to a god.&#8221; This confirms that
   early Christians were worshipping Jesus as a divine figure shortly after his
   lifetime.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>The Babylonian Talmud</strong> (Jewish rabbinic texts): Contains
   references to Jesus, generally hostile, acknowledging that he was executed on
   the eve of Passover.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <h4>B. Early Christian Sources (The New Testament)</h4>

 <p>
  The New Testament is the primary source of information, but historians
  differentiate between its theological claims and its historical content:
 </p>

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>Pauline Epistles (Letters of Paul):</strong> These are the
   <strong>earliest surviving Christian writings</strong> (dating from the 50s
   and 60s AD, only about 20&#8211;30 years after Jesus&#8217;s death). Paul
   claims to have met and interacted with eyewitnesses, including Jesus&#8217;s
   brother, <strong>James</strong>, and his closest disciples, Peter and John,
   treating Jesus as a real person.
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>The Gospels:</strong> Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are considered
   ancient biographies written in the style of the time, primarily focused on
   recounting the life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus. Historians
   use various criteria (like the
   <strong>criterion of embarrassment</strong>—details embarrassing to the early
   church, like his baptism by John) to separate historical memory from
   theological tradition.
  </li>
 </ul>

 <h3>2. The Claim of &#8220;Son of God&#8221;</h3>

 <p>
  The claim that Jesus is the <strong>&#8220;Son of God&#8221;</strong> is a
  central element of Christian faith and is found throughout the New Testament,
  but it is not a claim that can be verified or refuted through standard
  historical and archaeological methods.
 </p>

 <ul>
  <li>
   Historical documents, including non-Christian ones, confirm the existence of
   a man named Jesus who was a teacher, had a following, and was crucified.
  </li>
  <li>
   The historical evidence also confirms that his followers almost immediately
   began worshipping him as divine (&#8220;Christ as to a god,&#8221; per Pliny)
   and that they believed in his resurrection (as implied by Tacitus&#8217;s
   mention of a &#8220;mischievous superstition&#8230; again broke out&#8221;).
  </li>
 </ul>
